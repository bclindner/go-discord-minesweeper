# go-discord-minesweeper

This is a simple Discord bot that generates Minesweeper boards.

# Usage

Download the binary or compile the source, then put this in a `config.json` file
in the same directory as the bot:
```json
{
  "token": "<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>"
}
```

Launch the bot, and type `!minesweeper` anywhere the bot has access to, and it
should spit out a perfectly workable Minesweeper board.
